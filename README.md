This app is for musicians to practice their sight reading. Select your settings then press play. You will hear 4 clicks of a metronome and then it is time to show off your skills. Press the key on your keyboard that represents the current note being played. For example, type "c" when middle C is played. Time your keypress to be right when the metronome clicks. For each note, if you type the correct note name the note will turn green. If you play the wrong note, it will turn red. Practice that melody over again if you don't get it perfect or generate a new melody.

Enjoy!
